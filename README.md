# CommOT
A new framework named Communication Optimal Transport (CommOT) for computing the rate distortion (RD) function.

The Alternating Sinkhorn (AS) algorithm is presented in “A Communication Optimal Transport Approach to the Computation of Rate Distortion Functions”
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10161675

# The Code for AS algorithm
The latest code is in RD_CBA.m file.
